`Hello, world!,`
It's been a while that I wanted to start blogging, but you know well that the beginning is always the hardest.
This post has been published, so I passed the hardest part ðŸ˜ƒ.
## Being Existed
You've to share and show off to the world what you know and what you're capable of, It's very simple, you should be existed.  
Assume that you know many things in many topics,
No one knows about you, until you show yourself to others. Expressing yourself and sharing knowledge with blogging is way to showing yourself and being existed.  
It's like advertising, If Nike hadn't advertised its product, no one would've known that Nike existed.
## Learning More
Blogging forces you to learn more accurately and detailed. You'll go deeper on the topic with research and more reading, Because you don't want to screw it up.  

> The More you give, the More you Receive.

## Writing Skills In English
I'm not a native speaker of English, It would be a good practice to get better and better over time. The more you write, the better you become at it.  
The key to success is Writing constantly and taking small steps, Although I do my best to write better, but by the way I'm not writer and I don't intend to be a writer.
